"""Reusable endpoint-diagnostics harness. The repo's local sandbox (Claude
sessions) usually can't reach career sites, but GitHub Actions can: write
probes into main(), push, dispatch the `probe` workflow (workflow_dispatch
only), read the Actions log, iterate. Keep main() empty between
investigations; findings belong in companies.yaml notes / CLAUDE.md.

History: rounds 1-4 on 2026-07-18 diagnosed the whole broken-roster backlog —
see the notes in companies.yaml and the probe-workflow section in CLAUDE.md."""
